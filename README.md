## Introduction:
Music is a universal language. We all know that music has the power to connect people, stir our emotions, and make life a little brighter. It's our go-to comfort, a way to express ourselves, and a way to bring people together. With this in mind, our team set out on a mission to create something special: "Sarang" a web app dedicated to unlocking the therapeutic power of music.

## Inspiration and Background:
Our journey began with a shared love for music. We bonded by singing songs during those dull lectures. When the chance to participate in a hackathon came our way, naturally, our inclination towards music guided us to explore ways to make the music experience even more special. We noticed a gap in existing music platforms, inspiring us to create a solution that tailors music to individual moods in real time.

## Project Overview:
Imagine Sarang as your personal DJ, curating playlists using the Iso Principle—an effective technique used by professionals in music therapy. The user will have to answer a few questions about their current state of mind, and voilà! Sarang, powered by cool Machine Learning tech, whips up a playlist that is personalised for you. If you're feeling anxious, it starts with calming tunes, moves to uplifting melodies, and finishes with energising beats—gradually shifting your mood.

Tech Stack we're using:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Python
* Flask

## Conclusion:
Sarang isn't just another music streaming platform; think of it as your music therapy session. Our goal? To provide you with more than just entertainment—to lift your mood, promote mental wellness, and make your day a bit brighter. By blending the art of music with the precision of Machine Learning, we aim to contribute to the understanding of music as a therapeutic and transformative force in your life. Enjoy the journey!
