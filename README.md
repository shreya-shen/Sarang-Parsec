# Sarang-Parsec -  Find your true tune

## Introduction:
Music is a universal language. We all know that music has the power to connect people, stir our emotions, and make life a little brighter. It's our go-to comfort, a way to express ourselves, and a way to bring people together. With this in mind, our team set out on a mission to create something special: "Sarang" a web app dedicated to unlocking the therapeutic power of music.

## Inspiration and Background:
Our journey began with a shared love for music. We bonded by singing songs during those dull lectures. When the chance to participate in a hackathon came our way, naturally, our inclination towards music guided us to explore ways to make the music experience even more special. We noticed a gap in existing music platforms, inspiring us to create a solution that tailors music to individual moods in real time.

## Project Overview:
Imagine Sarang as your personal DJ, curating playlists using the Iso Principle—an effective technique used by professionals in music therapy. The user will have to answer a few questions about their current state of mind, and voilà! Sarang, powered by cool Machine Learning tech, whips up a playlist that is personalised for you. If you're feeling anxious, it starts with calming tunes, moves to uplifting melodies, and finishes with energising beats—gradually shifting your mood.

## Historical and Therapeutic Context:
Music therapy isn't a new concept; it has roots in ancient civilizations, like India, where ragas were used for therapeutic purposes. Modern research backs up what our ancestors knew: music can boost your mood, ease stress, and even aid in the healing process. Music therapy has been a game-changer for people dealing with autism, ADHD, and cerebral palsy.

## Implementation through Machine Learning:
How does Sarang work its magic? We've got Machine Learning algorithms analysing your responses to predict your emotional state. This, combined with a vast music database, lets Sarang create playlists tailored to your emotional needs. It learns and evolves, getting better with every song choice based on your feedback and interactions.

## Conclusion:
Sarang isn't just another music streaming platform; think of it as your music therapy session. Our goal? To provide you with more than just entertainment—to lift your mood, promote mental wellness, and make your day a bit brighter. By blending the art of music with the precision of Machine Learning, we aim to contribute to the understanding of music as a therapeutic and transformative force in your life. Enjoy the journey!
